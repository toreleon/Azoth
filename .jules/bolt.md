## 2024-05-14 - Time-Series O(log n) Search Pattern
**Learning:** `src/agent/backtestRunner.ts` makes heavy use of `.filter((b) => b.time <= asOf)` to get the latest close price inside loop bounds, changing potentially O(1) loop lookups or O(log n) lookups into repetitive O(n) filtering over large arrays.
**Action:** Expose `findLastBarIndex` in `src/data/sources/dnsePublic.ts` and use binary search or track indices explicitly in tight loops.

## 2024-05-18 - Avoid O(n) array filtering and sorting on time-series market data
**Learning:** Time-series market data arrays (like OHLCV bars) in this codebase are inherently chronologically sorted. Using `.filter(b => b.time >= start && b.time <= end).sort(...)` is an O(n) anti-pattern.
**Action:** When extracting sub-intervals from chronologically sorted time-series arrays, use O(log n) binary search utilities (like `findFirstBarIndex` and `findLastBarIndex`) to find lower and upper bounds, followed by `.slice(startIdx, endIdx + 1)` instead.
